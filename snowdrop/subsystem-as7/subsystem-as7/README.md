Snowdrop JBoss Subsystem AS7
============================

Purpose:
--------

Bootstraps and registers the application contexts to be used by your Java EE applications.

Bootstraps and registers the Snowdrop subsystem with the extension context in JBoss, enabling it to be able 
to marshal the subsystem's model back to the main configuration file when it is modified.

A thorough explanation of what happens here can be found in the [JBoss AS 7 docs](https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS7/Extending+JBoss+AS+7)
