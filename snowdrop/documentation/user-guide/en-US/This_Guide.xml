    <title>Supported Spring Version</title>
    <para>
      Snowdrop 2.0 and subsequent micro-release versions (2.0.1, 2.0.2,
      etc.) should be used with Spring 2.5 (preferred version being
      Spring 2.5.6.SEC03) or Spring 3.0 (preferred version being
      3.0.7.RELEASE and above). Later Spring versions (3.1, 3.2. etc.) may
      be compatible with Snowdrop 2.0 as long as they maintain binary
      compatibility with Spring 3.0. In such cases, the instructions
      regarding Spring 3.0 apply to Spring 3.1 and later as well.
